Favouritism is highly evident in the promotions process and is based on your ability to do extra work, which translates into working overtime so is highly discriminatory to moms and people with family responsibility.

XPTs are where Amazon gives packages to flex drivers who then deliver to the customer's home. It's a new concept for Amazon and they obviously have many things to figure out. Trying to be polite so try to read between the lines there. There's a certain number of frustrations but it's made up for by being an ridiculously easy job and having a flexible schedule. Speaking of schedule, you're not guaranteed hours so heads up there. If you have any issues the managers won't be much help. They want all the scheduling and human resources functions done through the A to Z app. I've tried to contact someone through that app once and was basically unable to communicate with them because of our accents. They do have ways to win raffles and prizes and stuff especially if you have a good manager so that makes up a little for it.
I'd say this job is only good for those who need a flexible schedule or just some extra cash OR someone who really wants to work for Amazon and an XPT site is the only option available.

The only bad thing is, the unpaid personal time determines if they’re going to let you go. You only have so many hours, but it does accumulate every quarter.

When they’re not, beware. Often times you are asked to complete objectives without the proper support. For example, on a shift where there should be multiple managers, poor planning by senior leadership leads to shifts like this where there is one. Your then held accountable for the shift doing three managers jobs for the price of one.

It’s really the luck of the draw on if you get a good direct manager. I’ve had great ones and I’ve had terrible ones. Some will put you in a position to be successful and others use you as their scapegoat. Don’t listen to there media department when they say they are doing this and that to build the company culture, they’re not. The message the public sees is just that, but their boots on the ground teams don’t practice that. Fair pay, but definitely over worked.

As mentioned earlier, when things are going well it’s a cool place to work. It’s just their rate of attrition that keeps the times going in a negative direction more often. You’ll find yourself working like a dog and feel a sense of accomplishment after finishing just to find out they want you to do better. This leads me back to the support of senior leadership teams. Your not given the resources to be successful. Bad managers run rampant and they will pull the rug out from under you in a heartbeat.

Some relationships are cherished with the people you work with. You can make good friends, solid networking opportunities and possibilities to advance.

The coworkers are the best part. Sure, there are some lazy people, they hire anyone, and the bar is pretty low.

Favoritism plays a HUGE role in promotion. I have never wanted to follow the FC management track, so that hasn't bothered me.

The work is physically very demanding, the hours are long, the physical environment is huge and, while climate controlled and pretty well-lit, it's loud and dirty and under-illuminated. If you are sensitive to your environment, or environmental stimuli, avoid this place.

I started as a seasonal employee at the begining of the pandemic and converted to full time a few months later. it takes 30 days to get benefits. I pay a little extra for the best health insurance plan (because I use it) and it's totally worth it. I Best I've ever had. 401K matching is a little stingy, but it's somethig.

They offer good accommodations for people with disabilities. HR is a pain but it does work. It's a pretty inclusive and diverse facility, and that's evident in management. They also help military vets and spouses onboard into careers.

If you are a hard worker, and don't have a college degree, you can still work your way up. There's opportunity. That being said, you won't earn as much as someone with a college degree.

Pay is also good.,"Amazon has great pay and good benefits. Working hours and conditions are just terrible. Forced to do overtime at the last minute. Sometimes 12 hour days, for 6 days a week. They don't want to hear it if you tell them it's too much. Management treats employees like slaves. To them, we are robots, not humans. Training is also horrible. They expect you will know how to do something without being taught. The warehouse is very large. Most of your break is used up walking to and from the break room; 10 minutes each way. Management has no compassion for anyone. Amazon cares only about making the figures. If you are young and in great shape, you may be able to handle it.
